With this in mind, we've grouped units by baffle diameter and mounting holes. This categorization can help you find compatible units for your existing enclosure. However, please note that inserting bass-reflex-oriented units into back-loaded horn enclosures may not produce the desired sound. We have allowed a margin of Â±1mm for discrepancies, but in many cases, a difference of up to 3mm might still work if the mounting holes align."

      abst: "For selecting speaker units suitable for back-loaded horn enclosures, it is commonly recommended to choose units with a strong magnetic circuit, a low Qts (Total Quality Factor, also referred to as Q0) indicating an over-damped tendency, and components made from high-rigidity materials with appropriate internal loss (often paper, kenaf, kevlar, etc.). These characteristics often result in units with high efficiency (Sound Pressure Level, SPL). Here, we have listed speaker units explicitly designed for back-loaded horn enclosures by manufacturers, sorted by Qts values. Please use this as a reference for your selection."
